# Electron Docs Parser

> Generate a structured JSON API file from Electron's free-form documentation

## Usage

```bash
yarn global add @electron/docs-parser
cd ~/projects/path/to/electron/repo
electron-docs-parser --dir ./

# You now have ./electron-api.json with the entire Electron API
```

Options:
* `--useReadme` - Assume all documentation is in the module's base `README.md` file 
* `--dir` - The base directory where documentation is located.
  * API documentation must be located in `/docs/api` within the specified base directory.
  * API structures documentation must be located in `/docs/api/structures` within the specified base directory.
* `--packageMode` - Can be `single` or `multi`; default `single`. Specifying `multi` allows exporting multiple packages from an API instead of multiple modules from a single package.

## How it Works

We generate a markdown AST for every documentation file and search for
"Modules", "Classes" and "Structures".  We then use the well documented
and enforced [Electron docs style guide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/styleguide.md) to pull the required information
about methods, properties and events from the generated AST.

For more information you should start your code dive in
[`DocsParser.ts`](src/DocsParser.ts) and then probably
[`block-parsers.ts`](src/block-parsers.ts).

## TypeScript Definitions

The output of this module is used to generate TypeScript definitions for
the Electron API. This module itself is not used to generate those
definitions - [@electron/typescript-definitions](https://github.com/electron/typescript-definitions) is.

Further, if you're looking for tooling that automatically surfaces
typings in GitHub PRs, you're probably looking for [Archaeologist](https://github.com/electron/archaeologist).
